    "### Spectral extraction issues\n",
    "\n",
    "The automated spectra extraction in the JWST calibration pipeline is very sensitive to coordinate inaccuracies, and as a result, the extract (``x1d``) products in MAST are often of poor quality. Specifically, the ``extract_1d`` step does not reliably place the extraction aperture in the correct place on the array. The algorithm uses the target coordinates in the metadata and the WCS information to place the aperture at the location of the target; the algorithm itself is actually very effective, but as it relies on accurate coordinate information both in the header and in the data WCS information, it is very sensitive to coordinate registration issues. Reasons for such coordinate issues are e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "* inaccuracies in the guide star coordinates that cause the RA, Dec registration of the field to be ofset\n",
    "* coordinate tarnsformation inaccuracies when resampling\n",
    "* target coordinate errors\n",
    "\n",
    "We are actively working on resolving these issues, and in the mean time are updating the specral extraction process to extract based on detector position rather than WCS location. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In this notebook we will demo how to perform a more accurate extraction manually using the JWST pipeline, for LEVEL 3 data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate how to get a well-calibrated and extracted spectrum from a Low-Resolution Spectroscopy (LRS) observation of a point source in the slit. We have chosen as example data an observation where the extracted products in MAST are affected by the above issues, and don't look right. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are actively working on improving the robustness of the spectral extraction algorithms. In the mean time, this notebook provides a template for how to work around the extraction issues and produce clean, well-extracted spectra. We will provide additional explanation along the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start from the Level 2a data. This is the file ending in ``rate.fits``. This data product has undergone basic detector calibration. The units are DN/s. \n",
    "\n",
    "The calibration steps assume the target is an unresolved point source, and that the observation used the ALONG SLIT NOD dither pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The custom extraction is applied at the Level 3 stage of the pipeline. We include the Spec2Pipeline to provide some extra info & context, but you can also jump in just for the Spec3Pipeline.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this notebook is an observation of the Type Ia supernova SN2021aefx, observed by Jha et al in PID 2072 (Obs 1), **where the automated spectral extraction failed**. These data were taken with zero exclusive access period, and published in [Kwok et al 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...944L...3K/abstract). You can retrieve the data from [this Box folder](https://stsci.box.com/s/i2xi18jziu1iawpkom0z2r94kvf9n9kb), and we recommend you place the files in the ``data/`` folder of this repository, or change the directory settings in the notebook prior to running. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can of course just use your own data instead of the demo data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### CRDS pmap 1088 update (May 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The LRS spectral extraction reference file updated in May 2023, starting from CRDS context (pmap) 1088, to address the issue described in this notebook.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will set the context explicitly to pmap 1084, so the pipeline outputs demonstrate the problem prior to the fix. You can see the effect of the update by changing the CRDS context number to a more recent version in the cell below. \n",
    "\n",
    "If your CRDS context is 1088 or higher, the LRS spectral extraction reference file used will have fixed coordinates specified as the extraction aperture. These coordinates are tailored to the Stage 3 Pipeline extraction (i.e. the dither-combined, resampled product), and the Level 3 products in MAST should be much improved. However, as the same extraction reference file is used for both the Stage 2 and Stage 3 iterations of ``extract_1d()``, the Level 2b extracted spectra will not be accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to examine the individual nod extracted spectra, use the methods demonstrated in this notebook to create a custom extraction file tailored to the 2D spectral images you'd like to extract, and run the step standalone.\n",

    "### Association vs. single file input\n",

However, for our default use case of a point source observation using the ALONG SLIT NOD pattern, the input to the Spec2Pipeline is an **association file**, which contains information for both files. The pipeline builds such files for all cases where multiple files need to be combined for pipeline execution. In the case of LRS slit observations, the ``background`` step performs a mutual subtraction of the nods. \n",

    "The association files used can also be downloaded from MAST. We demonstrate here how to build them from scratch using the tools provided in the pipeline package.
